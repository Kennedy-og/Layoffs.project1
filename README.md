# 💼 Global Layoffs Data Cleaning Project (SQL)

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a global layoffs dataset using **SQL**.  
The goal was to transform messy, duplicate-filled data into a clean, reliable dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
This project explores the **wave of layoffs** that have affected companies worldwide across various industries.  
The dataset contains information such as:
- Company name  
- Industry  
- Location  
- Country  
- Number and percentage of employees laid off  
- Company stage and funds raised  

The purpose of this project is to **standardize, clean, and structure** the data for accurate analysis — ensuring all duplicates, blanks, and formatting errors are properly handled.

---

## Objectives
- Detect and remove duplicate records.  
- Standardize company, country, and industry names.  
- Handle null and blank values logically.  
- Format dates properly for time-based analysis.  
- Prepare the dataset for downstream analysis or visualization.  

---

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **CTEs & Window Functions** – for identifying duplicates and ranking records  
- **Excel / Power BI (optional)** – for validation and visualization  

---

## Data Cleaning Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported raw layoffs dataset into MySQL database.
- Created a staging table (`layoffs_staging`) to avoid modifying original data.

### 2. Removing Duplicates
- Used `ROW_NUMBER()` and `DENSE_RANK()` window functions to identify duplicates.
- Verified duplicates using a CTE (`duplicate_cte`).
- Created a new table (`layoffs_staging2`) and deleted rows with duplicate identifiers.

### 3. Standardizing Data
- Trimmed extra spaces from company and country names using `TRIM()`.
- Cleaned industry names (e.g., changing “crypto” or “CryptoCurrency” → “Crypto”).
- Fixed inconsistent country formats (e.g., “United States.” → “United States”).

### 4. Formatting Dates
- Converted text-based date values into proper `DATE` format using `STR_TO_DATE()`.
- Altered the column datatype to ensure consistent date handling.

### 5. Handling Null or Blank Values
- Identified missing `industry` values and filled them by referencing matching company data.
- Removed records where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were missing.

### 6. Dropping Irrelevant Columns
- Dropped helper columns (like `row_id`) after cleaning to maintain a professional dataset.

## Key SQL Techniques
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** – for organized duplicate checking.  
- **Window Functions** – for ranking and partitioning duplicate records.  
- **String Functions** – `TRIM()`, `LIKE`, and pattern matching for data standardization.  
- **Date Functions** – `STR_TO_DATE()` for proper date formatting.  
- **Conditional Updates & Joins** – to fill missing values intelligently.

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Inconsistent industry labels | Used pattern matching and manual corrections (`LIKE 'crypto%' → 'Crypto'`). |
| Duplicate entries with same company details | Applied `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioning and removed rows with `row_num > 1`. |
| Text-formatted date columns | Used `STR_TO_DATE()` and changed datatype to `DATE`. |
| Null industry fields | Joined on company name to fill missing industry info. |

---

## Results
After cleaning:
- The dataset became **fully standardized**, **duplicate-free**, and **ready for analysis**.  
- Null values and inconsistent text entries were resolved.  
- Data integrity was preserved for trend and industry-level layoff insights.
